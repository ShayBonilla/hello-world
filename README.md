# hello-world
Beginning project on orientation to GitHub and using a code hosting platform
Hello there! My name is Shay, and I am following this guide to get started with Github!
I am a new mommy, an awesome wife, a lifetime learner, and hoping to one day become a developer. 
For now, I know the basics of Python. I am learning Java, HTML, CSS, and data structure. 
I am also currently working on my Google IT Support Professional Certification.
